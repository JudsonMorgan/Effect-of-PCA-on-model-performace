# Effect-of-PCA-on-model-performace
A simple project to illustrate the effect of PCA (pricipal component analysis) on the accuracy score. In this project, we are going to do the following: 1. Load our dataset `heart.csv` data 2. Perform outlier detection and removal on some data features using zcore greater than -3 or less than 3. 3. Standardized our data 4. Building our machine learning model by comparing three different models (SVM, RandomForest, and Logistic Regression) on the same dataset. 5. Now, we apply Dimensionality reduction technique using pca to see how it affect model's performance.
